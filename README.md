## 📌 Project Objective

To detect behavioral patterns that indicate a user's risk of abandoning the Waze platform and provide actionable insights to improve user retention proactively.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`  
- Machine Learning: `Scikit-learn`, `XGBoost`  
- Environment: `Jupyter Notebook`

## 📁 Repository Structure

```bash
📁 data/         # Base dataset used for analysis  
📁 notebooks/    # Exploratory analysis and ML models  
📁 reports/      # Executive summaries and final reports  
📄 README.md     # Project documentation
```

## 📊 Key Results

- Classification model reached **XX% accuracy** *(replace with your real result)*  
- Top predictive features:  
  - Frequency of app usage  
  - Zone-switching behavior  
  - Traffic report interactions  
- Identified high-risk segments with **interactive visualizations**  
- Strong model performance validated through cross-validation techniques

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pashitox/waze-churn-prediction.git
```

Open the notebooks and follow the steps to preprocess data, train models, and interpret results.

## 🔮 Next Steps (Optional)

- Integrate with Waze API for real-time user scoring  
- Build dashboards for live churn monitoring  
- Test model across new regions or languages  
- Deploy as a microservice for internal use
